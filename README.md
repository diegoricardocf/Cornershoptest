This Amazing App can count anything that you want
You just need an internet connection to add items and count them

To make this App, I used these techs:
*MVVM
*Retrofit
*Coroutines
*Mockito
*Koin(Dependency Injection)
*LiveData
*Junit(Tests)
*Lottie(For animations)


Some unit tests have been added in the project
