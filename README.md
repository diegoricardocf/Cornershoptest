This Amazing App can count anything that you want
You just need an internet connection to add items and count them

To make this App, I used these techs:

* MVVM
* Retrofit
* Coroutines
* Mockito
* Koin(Dependency Injection)
* LiveData
* Junit(Tests)
* Lottie(For animations)

Some unit tests have been added in the project

You can see a demo below
